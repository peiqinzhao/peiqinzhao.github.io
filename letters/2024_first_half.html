<b>HEDERA THOUGHTS</b>

To the reader:

Here I list some basic information about the portfolio performance in the
first half the year. By the end of this month I'll update this doc to include
what I've learnt from the market in the first half the year.

Year  Pre-tax[1]  SPY      QQQ 
2018  (25.64%)  (8.07%)  (10.73%)
2019  7.28%     28.65%   37.27%
2020  21.54%    15.09%   45.14% 
2021  58.53%    28.79%   28.63%
2022  (12.33%)  (20.28%) (34.16%) 
2023  30.92%    25.13%   55.59%  
2024  7.24%[2]  13.91%   16.45% 

Total 189%      199%     272%

1) All returns for the baseline are pre-tax and do not account for dividends.

2) The current tax liablity may decrease the return to 4.6% only.

2) All the newly-committed capitals are assumed to be contributed in the beginning
   year. As a result, the actual yield should be slightly higher than value here.
